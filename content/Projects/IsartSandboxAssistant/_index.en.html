Isart Digital is a college centered around video game development.</br>
It possesses a Game Programming cursus.</br>
In August, each year, the cursus had a selection step called the "Sandbox", where students could learn C by solving algorithms and programming games.</br>
At the end of each week, students were given a special subject, without getting any help, and got graded on them. 

</br>

I worked as an assistant during August 2021.</br>
