At first, I just got inspired to make a board game to play with friends, so I made semi automatic by making a discord bot using Discord.py to help with randomness, hiding cards, etc. However, I then decided to let the bot render directly the game and handle all of the logic. But what’s better than a Game Engine to make a game? So I made a wrapper of the Godot API myself and used that to generate images.
